This program can be used to calculate the tip according to the tip percentage. By default I have assumed 3 types of percentage for tip (18%, 20%, and 25%). It will calculate the tips with respect to the default tip percentage from the total bill. 

At first user will give the inputs like the total bill, number of persons, contribution percentage for each head (Note: Total contribution percentage must be 100, otherwise the program will exit). Then the system will display the tips in dollar according to the tip percentage (18%, 20%, 25%). It also shows the net amount included the tips with rounded figure. Then it shows the contribution for each of the person according to the percentage they gave for the tip percentage (18%, 20%, 25%). Thatâ€™s how this system works.
